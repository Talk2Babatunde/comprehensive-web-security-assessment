# Methodology

This assessment followed the OWASP Testing Guide v4 framework and simulated a real-world penetration test.

## Phases:
1. **Reconnaissance:** Identify domains, DNS records, and services using `nslookup`, `dig`, and `Nmap`.
2. **Enumeration:** Determine open ports and potential entry points.
3. **Exploitation:** Execute attacks like CSRF, IDOR, SSTI, and privilege escalation.
4. **Post-Exploitation:** Confirm impact and gather proof-of-concepts.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings with risk ratings and remediation advice.
